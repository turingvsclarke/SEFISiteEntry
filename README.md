# SEFI HSEF Potential Site
A server-side website entered as a candidate for the Science Education Foundation of Indiana Hoosier Science and Engineering Fair to use as their main site. Team lead was Ryan Eades, with three other students of varying backgrounds and experience. The website uses PHP, MySql, and front-end tools like Ajax, Jquery, and JavaScript to make calls to a database for organizing a high school science fair with judges, administrators, and student participants. Unfortunately, the site is currently not live, as it used a defunct server hosted by IUPUI's Computer Science Department. I am currently rebuilding the site to work better and will hopefully host that version on my own server soon. In the meantime, head to the below link to watch our first two project presentations. I apologize for any unprofessionalism displayed in the videos. It was fall 2020 and we all were just hoping to make it through the end of the year, so may be slap-happy or unhinged at times.
